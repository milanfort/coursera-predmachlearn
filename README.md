# Training Quality Detection

This repository contains our final project for the
[Practical Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/practical-machine-learning)
online course, a part of
[Data Science Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science)
from Johns Hopkins University on Coursera.

The task was to build a prediction model in R for classifying the quality of performed fitness excercise using data from on-body sensors. The full data analysis report 
is available at
